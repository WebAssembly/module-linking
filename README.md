# Module Linking Proposal for WebAssembly

**Note: This proposal is currently inactive, with work having moved on to
the [component-model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) repo. The
proposal could become active again in the future if there is renewed interest
in adding the module linking concepts to Core WebAssembly.**

----

This repository is a clone of [github.com/WebAssembly/spec/](https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/).
It is meant for discussion, prototype specification and implementation of a
proposal to add support for module linking to WebAssembly.

See the [explainer](proposals/module-linking/Explainer.md) for a summary of the
proposal.

# spec

This repository holds the sources for the WebAssembly draft specification
(to seed a future
[WebAssembly Working Group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Jun/0005.html)),
a reference implementation, and the official testsuite.

A formatted version of the spec is available here:
[webassembly.github.io/spec](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/),

Participation is welcome. Discussions about new features, significant semantic
changes, or any specification change likely to generate substantial discussion
should take place in
[the WebAssembly design repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
first, so that this spec repository can remain focused. And please follow the
[guidelines for contributing](Contributing.md).
